## Reg Acc.py (Garena Auto-Account Creator)

This one is simple but super handy if you need to stock up on Garena accounts (for League, Arena of Valor, etc.). No more manual registration headaches.

### Why use it?
- **100% Automated:** Just enter how many accounts you want, and it'll fetch them from the API for you.
- **Fast & Efficient:** Runs through the registration quickly with a small delay to avoid getting blocked.
- **Auto-Save:** Every account created gets dumped straight into `accgarena.txt` in the same folder. You won't lose your data if the script stops.
- **Clean CLI:** Simple terminal interface with color-coded status updates.

### How to use:
1. Install this first:
   ```bash
   pip install requests colorama
   ```
2. Run the script: `python a.py`
3. Enter the number of accounts you need, let it do its thing, and then check `accgarena.txt` for your new logins.
